- **Your thesis**, which should be specific and fresh. Think of this less like a topic (for example, conversation skills or time management*)* and more like an actual statement or stance (for example, “People think gossip is bad but it’s actually good because it can create social cohesion and remind us of how to act in a society,” or “You don’t have to say yes to everything people ask of you and having this system of these seven yes/no questions will help you not to overcommit”).
- **Your backup**, by which we mean the names of any experts you plan to interview, links to research you plan to cite, or specific examples of the thing you want to highlight.
- **The takeaways for the reader**. While we have a lot of respect for a writing process that’s about discovering as you go… this is not the time for that. You know? You know. Start knowing where you’re going to finish.
